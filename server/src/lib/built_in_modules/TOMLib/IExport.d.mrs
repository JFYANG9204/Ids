    Each `Export` object represents an export plug-in that can be used to export the tables in the document to a particular output format. The `Export` object serves to make the presence of the export plug-in transparent to the user of the `Table Object Model`.
    !'
    Interface IExport Implements Object

        '!

        The `ClassId` string of the class that implements the export plug-in.
        !'
        ReadOnly Property ClassId() As String

        '!

        The location of the binary code for the plug-in. This will typically be the location of a signed CAB file for download from a web server. This is to enable the export plug-in to be downloaded and run on the client in a client/server situation.
        !'
        ReadOnly Property CodeBase() As String

        '!

        A description of the export plug-in
        !'
        ReadOnly Property Description() As String

        '!

        If there is no `CodeBase` specified then `IsServerOnly` is *True*, because there is no code that can be downloaded and run on the client.
        !'
        ReadOnly Property IsServerOnly() As Boolean

        '!

        The name of the `Export` object and the corresponding export plug-in
        !'
        ReadOnly Property Name() As String

        '!

        The `Parent` property of the `Export` object always returns an `Exports` collection
        !'
        ReadOnly Property Parent() As IExports

        '!

        The exact `Property` objects in the collection are dependent on the particular export plug-in. For more information, see `Exporting` Tables.
        !'
        ReadOnly Property Properties() As IProperties

        '!

        Invokes the export plug-in in order to export the specified tables.

        ### Remarks
        The `Destination` parameter is used as a short-cut. If the export plug-in has a `Destination` property then its value is set to the value of the `Destination` parameter. If the export plug-in does not have a destination property then the `Destination` parameter is ignored.

        ### Example
        ```ds
        TableDoc.Exports["mrHtmlExport"].Export("C:\tables\agebygender.htm", "Table4")
        ```
        !'
        Function Export(Optional Destination As Variant, Optional Tables As Variant) As Variant
        End Function

    End Interface
